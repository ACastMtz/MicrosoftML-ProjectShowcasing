# Cardiovascular_Disease
Train models using the Cardiovascular Disease dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)

✅ Cardiovascular Disease dataset is a Kaggle Dataset the containts history of health status of some persons. A group of them suffered a heart attackt. So using this dataset we can train a model in order to predict if a person could suffer a heart attack.

# Conslussions
Data required in order to predict if a person could suffer a heart attack: [age, gender, heigth, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, gluosa, smole]

✅ In many regions with a high poverty rate there are hospitals with basic equipment. Sick people come to be treated for very common illnesses such as heart attacks, but many times doctors cannot help them due to lack of equipment. Thus this solution can help doctors to predict in time whether a person is prone to suffer an attack and thus give them timely treatment. Hope this solution can motivate to other people to use Machine Learning on Health.
